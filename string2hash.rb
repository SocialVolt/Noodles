# Given this array of strings
# use whatever means you would consider to be most correct/clean/rad
# to output a hash where the integer portion of each string is a key,
# with it's corresponding name as the value.
# prove it's correctness using a simple test.
#
# EXAMPLE
#
# Given
#   ['herp_11', 'derp_31']
# Expected output should be
#   { 11 => 'herp', 31 => 'derp' }
